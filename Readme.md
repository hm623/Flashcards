Flashcards


## Lab 2

### App Description
This updated flashcard app now allows users to create and edit the question box and answer box. Users are also able to edit the multiple choices under the question/answer box. When any of the text fields are left blank in the creation page (not the edit page), users are given an error warning reminding them the necessity to fill in all textfields. If the user decides to not create a new question and answer, the cancel button allows the user to return to the main screen. Created a reset button to reset the question/answer when accidentally revealed. Background colors are also changed for a more pleasing look.

## Lab 1

### App Description
A simple question and answer flashcard app that involves gesture recognition and three buttons. Also involves iOS styling for labels and buttons, with rounded corners and shadows.

### App Walk-though
Answer is revealed when clicking on the question box. Wrong answers are hidden after clicking them and will reset when the question box is clicked. The correct answer reveals the answer box. And again, everything resets when the question box/answer box is clicked.
